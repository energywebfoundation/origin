# 6. Rename assets to devices

Date: 2019-12-04

## Status

Accepted

## Context

There has been confusion on why we call generating and consuming devices Assets in Origin. We have noticed that most Origin users would refer to Assets as Devices and not Assets.

## Decision

We decided to change our terminology to refer to Assets as Devices, to keep in line with the prevailing terminology in the industry.

## Consequences

Our package `asset-registry` has now been renamed to `device-registry`.
