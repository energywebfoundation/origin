*NOTE: If you're looking to build your own libraries to interact with the smart contracts of the user registry, please check the contracts in the [contracts](contracts/) folder and test them with those contracts.*

## Summary
User Registry is used to keep track of the users that are a part of the **EW-Chain** ecosystem of DApps.

This repo contains the **smart contracts** and the **JavaScript/Typescript libraries** to interact with those contracts.
