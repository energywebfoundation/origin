# Packages

Origin consist of publicly available NPM packages that allow developers to build their own [Energy Attribute Certificate (EAC)](./user-guide-glossary.md#energy-attribute-certificate) traceability and trading solutions.  

The SDKs are structured  so that implementers to pick and chose from the suite of available SDK components, as well as allow them to create custom implementations for for other issuers, such as I-REC.

By design, the SDK packages are loosely coupled, which enables the possibility to implement solutions that consist of only part of the Origin features, such as:

-   issuance only
-   device registry only
-   trading only

**I-REC ** packages that contains [I-REC](https://www.irecstandard.org/) specific implementations

Naming scheme:

-   **api** suffix - packages that contains Nest.JS based API endpoints _for e.g @energyweb/origin-device-registry-api_
-   **client** suffix - packages that contains auto-generated Typescript client libraries for **api** projects _for e.g @energyweb/origin-device-registry-api-client_
-   **wrapper** suffix - packages that contains wrapper libraries for external APIs _for e.g @energyweb/issuer-irec-api-wrapper_
