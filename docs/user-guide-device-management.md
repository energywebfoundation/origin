# User Guide - Device Management

If you are a device manager, you can register and manage generation devices through the Origin marketplace.

## Device Registration

To register a device, enter the device details in the registration form. You are asked to input name, technical data and location data about the device. You can choose to upload device images and add a description about the project in the Project Story.

Origin offers the possibility to connect an external metering system. In order for this to work, a custom integration to the specific metering system is required. Devices have to be approved by the issuer in order to be used on the platform.

The local issuer receives the device registration and can verify the data and approve the device. Everything that involves additional processes of the registry, e.g. if there is a need for an on-site visit or additional documents, is handled directly between the user and the registry.

If you are using the demo marketplace and want your devices to be approved, send a message to the EWF team.

## Requesting Certificates for Device

To request certificates, you have to choose the specific generation device and specify the time frame. Monthly certification is the most common practice in the market but most standards allow for a daily granularity.

Requesting certificates for a specific generation device happens manually as most standards do not allow for SCADA data to be used as generation evidence. The user is required to upload the official settlement document provided by the grid operator as generation evidence. The evidence has to be provided for the right generation device and time frame to be approved.

The local issuer receives the certification request, can verify the evidence and approve the request. The request is recorded as a blockchain transaction on-chain.
