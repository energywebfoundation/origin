### Buy Bundle

To purchase a bundle, select the bundle by double clicking on it. The Bundle Details interface presents possible bundle offers based on the ratios defined by the seller. The buyer can specify a budget using the slidable price range so that possible offerings are filtered and the buyer can easily choose the package that fulfills the requirements and purchase it directly. To buy a package, select the desired package and click “Buy” (shown below).
